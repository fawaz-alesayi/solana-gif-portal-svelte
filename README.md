# buildspace Solana GIF Portal Project
*Note: This is a bit different from the original project since it was made with Svelte!*

### **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**
To get started with this project, clone this repo and follow these commands:

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed

1. Run `pnpm install` at the root of your directory
2. Run `pnpm start` to start the project
3. Start coding!

### **Questions?**
Have some questions make sure you head over to your [buildspace Dashboard](https://app.buildspace.so/courses/CObd6d35ce-3394-4bd8-977e-cbee82ae07a3) and link your Discord account so you can get access to helpful channels and your instructor!


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
pnpm build
```

> You can preview the built app with `pnpm preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
